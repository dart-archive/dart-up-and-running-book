Dart: Up and Running
=============

This is the book "Dart: Up and Running" by Kathy Walrath and Seth Ladd.
More info: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025719.do

An HTML version of this book is online at
http://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/.

As of February 2013, this is our primary repository for the book. (We'll copy the .xml files to the private
O'Reilly repo from time to time; they'll publish from their repo every few months.)

The code/ directory is up-to-date but incomplete.

Updating the dartlang.org copy of this book
------------------
Basically, you get the dartlang.org project, and you run `make book`.
See https://github.com/dart-lang/dartlang.org#readme for details.
